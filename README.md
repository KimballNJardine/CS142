# CS142
Projects for CS 142.

This contains various projects from my CS 142 Class, which I took in Winter 2022 at BYU (January - April 2022).
There is not a lot to say about it, other than if you are using this code to breeze through the class, you probably shouldn't be a CS major, as no assistance should be nessecary to complete an introductory course.
